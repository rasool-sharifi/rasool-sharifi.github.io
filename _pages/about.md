About me
------
I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Virginia, working with Prof. Ashish Venkat on Computer Architecture. My research interests lie broadly in Computer Architecture, Compilers, and Computer Security. My research explores novel hardware and software techniques to design secure machines while maintaining performance, energy efficiency,and high programmability. Iâ€™m also interested in applying novel machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate security threats. I have extensive experience in designing high performance, energy efficient FPGA and embedded systemsfor core consumer products. You can find my CV here.

**Speculative Super-optimization: Boosting Performance via Speculation-Driven Dynamic Binary Optimization**\

\

This project explores dynamic binary optimization techniques at the processor level to speculatively generate and execute a super-optimized instruction stream, by leveraging established speculative processor features such as branch prediction, value prediction, and loop stream detection. This project introduces two distinct flavors of speculative super-optimization: (a) a hardware implementation that leverages dynamically predicted program state to perform simple, yet powerful peephole optimizations on short instruction sequences, and (b) a firmware implementation that leverages a microcode-based dynamic re-compiler running as a helper thread to perform more sophisticated optimizations. Owing to the plethora of speculative processor features and compiler/runtime/hardware optimizations to choose from, this project explores a rich sample space of speculative super-optimization strategies, along with extensive profitability analysis to dynamically identify appropriate targets for super-optimization.
